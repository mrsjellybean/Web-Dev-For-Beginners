## Instructions

Imagine you are building a shopping cart. Write some documentation on the data types that you would need to complete your shopping experience. How did you arrive at your choices?

If I'd like to buy something like a ( https://www.amazon.se/kindle-paperwhite-8-gb-nu-med-en-68-tums-skarm-och-justerbart-varmt-ljus/dp/B08N36XNTT?pf_rd_r=7356K1NXRB0G4G2F2HSS&pf_rd_p=a486c717-4944-47d8-9f93-200b9f424213&pd_rd_r=332ada81-1e38-43ea-8684-e04cc73a29b0&pd_rd_w=xCOLk&pd_rd_wg=8H2SL&ref_=pd_gw_unk ).
