# Reading the Docs

## Instructions

There are many tools that a web developer may need that are on the [MDN documentation for client-side tooling](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Overview). Select 3 tools not covered in the lesson, explain why a web developer would use it, and search for a tool that falls under this category and share its documentation. Do not use the same tool example on MDN docs.


I've found these three cool tools:
1)Linters - really useful if the developer only start his way to programming, as this tool help to check the syntax and give tips have your could might be improved.

RuboCop - https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop/1.36/index.html 

2)Packagers - amazing tools for those who already have written some code and made a program, as this tool remove all lines and libraries components that haven't been used and make your code compact. Cool for memory capacity.

Jenkis WAR -https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/war-file/

3)And of course Testing tools - because any code always should be maintainable that's why it's really important to test it after all changes that were done.
